    height="80">](https://github.com/Mohammed-baqer-null/AndroidIDE-Rv2/releases)

> _Please install AndroidIDE-Rv2 from trusted sources only i.e._
> - [_GitHub Releases_](https://github.com/Mohammed-baqer-null/AndroidIDE-Rv2/releases)

- Download the AndroidIDE-Rv2 APK from the mentioned trusted sources.
- Follow the
  instructions [here](https://docs.androidide.com/tutorials/get-started.html) to
  install the build tools.

## Limitations

- For working with projects in AndroidIDE, your project must use Android Gradle Plugin v7.2.0 or
  newer. Projects with older AGP must be migrated to newer versions.
- SDK Manager is already included in Android SDK and is accessible in AndroidIDE-Rv2 via its Terminal.
  But, you cannot use it to install some tools (like NDK) because those tools are not built for
  Android.
- No official NDK support because we haven't built the NDK for Android.

The app is still being developed actively. It's in beta stage and may not be stable. if you have any
issues using the app, please let us know.
